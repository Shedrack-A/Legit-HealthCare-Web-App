### **Part 1: Set Up the Backend Server** ‚öôÔ∏è

You'll need one terminal window for this part.

1.  **Go to the Backend Folder:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Create a Private Workspace:** This keeps the project's tools separate from your computer's.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Workspace:**
    *   On Mac/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
    *   On Windows: `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
    (You should see `(venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt).

4.  **Install the Backend Tools:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Go Back to the Main Project Folder:**
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

6.  **Create the Database:** This sets up the database where all the information will be stored.
    ```bash
    export FLASK_APP=backend/app.py
    flask db upgrade --directory backend/migrations
    ```

7.  **Create the Admin User:** This is how you'll get full access to the application.
    ```bash
    # Replace <password> with a secure password of your choice
    flask create-admin <password>
    ```
    **Example:**
    ```bash
    flask create-admin YourSecurePassword123!
    ```
    This command will create the `admin` user with the password you provided. Remember it for login!

### **Part 2: Set Up the Frontend Interface** üñ•Ô∏è

For this, please **open a second, new terminal window**.

1.  **Go to the Frontend Folder:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install the Frontend Tools:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

---

### **Part 3: Run the Application!** üéâ

Now you'll start both servers.

1.  **Start the Backend:** In your **first terminal** (the one with `(venv)`), run:
    ```bash
    export FLASK_APP=backend/app.py
    flask run
    ```
    Leave this terminal running.

2.  **Start the Frontend:** In your **second terminal**, run:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This should automatically open a new tab in your web browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

You're all set! You can now go to the web page and log in with the username `admin` and the password you created.
